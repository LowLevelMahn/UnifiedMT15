1. Download the tools - all open source and free, all tools can just be unzip (no installation needed)

just unzip the exe - no installation needed!!

unilink: ftp://ftp.styx.cabel.net/pub/UniLink (use ftp client to download - most web-browser just stopped supporting ftp) 
-> ftp://ftp.styx.cabel.net/pub/UniLink/ulnb0101.zip (there is always only the latest version available named ulnb*.zip)
just unzip - no installation needed!!

2. unpack and copy the folders into the tools folder

rename the folder to match this hierarchy, no moving of single files - just the complete
folder - in the end these executables need to be reachable

tools\uasm_x64\uasm64.exe
tools\open-watcom-2_0-c-win-x64\binnt64\wcc.exe
tools\ulink\ulink.exe

3. make ulink work: 
outcomment or remove line 3 in tools\ulink\ulink.cfg  "!--remove this line--!" to activate the linker
